Methods for 2D Array Comparison in Python
1) Element-wise Comparison
You can compare each element in the arrays to see if they match.

2)  Check if Arrays are Exactly Equal (Overall)

3)  Using np.allclose() (Floating Point Comparisons)
If you are dealing with floating point numbers and want to check if they are approximately equal (within a tolerance), you can use np.allclose().
